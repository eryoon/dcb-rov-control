# DCB ROV Control 
This repository contains the base control code for Mirman's Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). Designed to work with Arduino microcontrollers.

## Dependencies
* [Arduino IDE](https://arduino.cc)
* [Adafruit MotorShield](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library)

## Setup
1. Download the Adafruit Motorshield Dependency listed above. From the green "Clone/Download" button, choose "Download ZIP".
2. Keep the ZIP file as is; don't bother unzipping it.
3. In the Arduino IDE, choose `Sketch → Include Library → Add Zip Library`.
4. Choose the ZIP file you just downloaded
5. Now, download _this_ library as a ZIP file. This one you _are_ going to unzip. Move the resulting folder into the Arduino folder in your home folder.
6. In Arduino, open `dcb-rov-control.ino`. That's it!
